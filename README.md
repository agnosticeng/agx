# agx

**_agx_** is a desktop application that lets you explore and query data through a modern interface. It's built with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/), [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and [Plot](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot), and can work in two ways: as a native desktop app using ClickHouse's embedded database ([chdb](https://github.com/chdb-io/chdb)), or as a web interface connected to a [Clickhouse](https://clickhouse.com/) server instance.

## Installing Agnostic UDF

Install Agnostic ClickHouse UDFs with a single command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agnosticeng/agx/main/scripts/install_agnostic_udfs.sh | sh
```

## Development

- The frontend is built with SvelteKit, offering a reactive and efficient UI
- The backend uses Tauri with Rust, providing native performance and security
- Communication between frontend and backend happens through Tauri's IPC bridge
- Data querying is handled by chdb, an embedded ClickHouse engine
