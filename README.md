## Installing Agnostic UDF

Install Agnostic ClickHouse UDFs with a single command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agnosticeng/agx/main/scripts/install_agnostic_udfs.sh | sh
```

## Development

- The frontend is built with SvelteKit, offering a reactive and efficient UI
- The backend uses Tauri with Rust, providing native performance and security
- Communication between frontend and backend happens through Tauri's IPC bridge
- Data querying is handled by chdb, an embedded ClickHouse engine
